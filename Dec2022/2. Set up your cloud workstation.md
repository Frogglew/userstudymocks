## Open Notebook interface
How to find the Notebook UI

## Create a compute instance to use Notebook and Terminal features
Instruction to create a compute instance and what this is for

## What options are available to bring your own code?
Explain three options, and walkthrough on git clone from an example repo

- Create a new notebook
- Direct file upload
- Pull from a repo

## Open terminal and git clone from an example repo (a simple .ipynb script)
In addition to the step-by-step on how to git clone on Azure Machine Learning Notebook UI, we will also explain that in some cases, users will need to access a private repo for push/pull. We link to a how-to doc that covers different methods (SSH, etc). 
 
- Open terminal on Notebook UI
- Authenticate to Git
- Bring local code to AzureML (via Git)

## Open a sample notebook that was cloned from Git repo

## How to generate/manage environment (including, selecting the kernel that matches the environment)
Explains different ways of creating and updating the environment.

- Create a new kernel environment
- Use a pre-installed kernel environment (there is a default pre-selected)
