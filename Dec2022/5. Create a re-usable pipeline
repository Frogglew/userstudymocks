# 5. Create a re-usable pipeline
Explains why use pipeline â€“ value props, conceptual understanding. In more advanced MLOps setup, you could just tweak existing pipeline template, but in this tutorial, we will walk you through a simple version of that so you can see what that is like.

## Open a sample notebook
It would contain main.py (mlflow python file), custom env, etc.

## choose a compute cluster for deployment
Explains how to choose a cluster for deployment (may use the cluster already created in the previous training tutorial)

## Create a custom environment

## Different ways of creating a pipeline
- UI (Designer)
- Component

## Edit the python file to create different steps (data pre-processing & training steps) 

## Submit a pipeline job

## Register the model
