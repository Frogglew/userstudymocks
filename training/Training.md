## Prerequisites
Complete the Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning to:

- Create a workspace.
- Create a cloud-based compute instance to use for your development environment.
- Create a new notebook or copy our notebook.

Follow the Quickstart: Run Juypter notebook in Azure Machine Learning studio steps to create a new notebook.
Or use the steps in the quickstart to clone the v2 tutorials folder, then open the notebook from the tutorials/azureml-in-a-day/azureml-in-a-day.ipynb folder in your File section.

## Connect to the workspace

## Create a compute cluster

## (Optional) Connect to your Git respository

## Select or create an environment
In order to train, you'll need an environment. An environemtn is [TBD]. Azure Machine Learning offers different options that meet your needs.

- You can automatically generate an environment for several popular models (classification, blah, blah, etc)
- You can select from pre-configured environments available on Azure ML platform.
- You can create a custom environment.

For this tutorial, we will go with the first option. 

[More explanation needed]

## Use or create a training script
Blah blah blah

You have several ways to go about it

- You can automatically generate the initial training script for several popular models (classification, blah, blah, etc)
- You can write a custom notebook
- You can bring your exiting code/notebook

For this tutorial, we will assume you don't have a script yet for this [X] model. We are going to walk you through how to generate a default training script using AutoML. Why using AutoML?

Benefits
- efficiency
- blah
- blah

Once you generate the initial training script via AutoML, in the next article, you'll learn how to customize it to refine your model further.

## Create a control script to submit the training job

## Pick the best model out of the initial training
